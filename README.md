# SpaceshipCollaborationActivity-Skeleton-30June2020

Skeleton repo for the Jun29-July2 run of the Spaceship Collaboration Activity. All colony ship subsystem controllers are empty and awaiting student code implementations.

Co-ordinate System: Cartesian (2D Vector?)
Angles: Radians (You can covert to degree if you need to debug, but all communication needs to happen with Radians)
Push/Pull: Can be picked by each subsystem/interface.
Method Signatures/Field Types: ???
Branches: 4 Branches, one for each subsytem (Defence, Propulsion, Navigation, Sensors)

For working between subsystems follow the instructions given in each Subsystem description in the manual NOT the diagram on page 20 of the manual
